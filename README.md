# Mikroe-Buggy
Paper presents one simple control algorithm for specific mobile robot system. The hardware architecture of the buggy robot and the use of certain types of sensors have been reviewed. The implementation of the movement of a mobile robot on a flat surface is presented and certain defects of applied robotic platforms have been discussed. A software library for sensors applied in this particular case has been established. Improvements of control structures by using intelligent systems and the data obtained from the sensors have been recommended. At the end of the paper there is a presentation of the results and potential further development suggestions.

Mobile robots, with their versatility in areas of application, gradually move from the classical industrial plants to our everyday lives. In most cases, people act and reside within a robotâ€™s working space. Consequently, such a working space becomes extremely dynamic; therefore, the robots are faced with growing demands for an intelligent behavior.

Establishing a safe trajectory within a dynamic working area is one of the main issues of mobile robotics. The solution of this task seems to be a prerequisite for solving more complex problems that robots face. The great progress in the development of robotics allowed for the emergence of new technologies for implementation of control systems - microcomputers, which have significantly increased the ability of the robots to, among other things, process a variety of sensor-received information in real time, based on which decisions are made as to what action should be carried out next. In that way, they perform tasks characterized by the reduced level of determinism.

Mobile robots explore new, unknown space using their sensors, which collect information about their environment in order to solve the problem of safe path [1-5]. Buggy represents a motorized robotic development platform, expandable with all types of sensors and transceivers, and as such is used for a very wide range of tasks.

The method presented in this paper represents the expansion of robotic development platforms. Buggy, with its infrared distance measuring sensors, respectively bypasses dynamic obstacles within the operation area of the robot, demonstrating integration of these components.
