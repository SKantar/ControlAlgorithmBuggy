# Mikroe-Buggy
Paper presents one simple control algorithm for specific mobile robot system. The hardware architecture of the buggy robot and the use of certain types of sensors have been reviewed. The implementation of the movement of a mobile robot on a flat surface is presented and certain defects of applied robotic platforms have been discussed. A software library for sensors applied in this particular case has been established. Improvements of control structures by using intelligent systems and the data obtained from the sensors have been recommended. At the end of the paper there is a presentation of the results and potential further development suggestions.
